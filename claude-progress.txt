## Session 2 Summary (Coding Agent)
Date: 2026-01-16

### Completed Tasks

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Verified worker login with correct credentials works
   - Confirmed test worker (John TestWorker, phone: 0821234567, PIN: 1234)

2. **Feature #7: Worker login - invalid PIN rejection** ✅
   - Tested login with incorrect PIN
   - Verified API returns proper error message: "Invalid phone number or PIN"
   - Confirmed no session is created for failed login attempts
   - User remains on login page after failure

3. **Feature #8: Worker logout functionality** ✅
   - Fixed bug: Authorization header wasn't being sent for /auth/logout endpoint
   - Updated api.js interceptor to include token for logout requests
   - Verified session is deleted from database on logout
   - Confirmed accessing protected routes with deleted token returns 401

4. **Feature #9: Worker PIN reset - request OTP** ✅
   - Created ForgotPin.js component with 3-step flow:
     - Step 1: Phone number entry
     - Step 2: OTP verification + new PIN entry
     - Step 3: Success confirmation
   - Added route /worker/forgot-pin to App.js
   - Verified OTP is created with purpose='pin_reset'
   - API correctly sends OTP to registered phone

### Bug Fixes

1. **Logout Authorization Header Bug**
   - File: `frontend/src/services/api.js`
   - Issue: axios interceptor only added Authorization header for /worker/* URLs
   - Fix: Added check for '/auth/logout' to include worker token

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `frontend/src/pages/worker/ForgotPin.js` - PIN reset flow component
- `backend/check-otp.js` - Debug script for OTP verification

**Modified:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Fixed logout authorization header
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added ForgotPin route

### Feature Statistics
- Total Features: 116
- Passing: 11 (was 6 at session start)
- In Progress: 0
- Completion: 9.5%

### Next Steps for Future Agents

1. **IMPORTANT: Restart backend server** before continuing - there are code fixes that require server restart
2. Continue with feature_get_next to get the next feature
3. Feature #12 (photo upload) and #13 (skills management) were skipped due to:
   - Browser lock issues preventing UI testing
   - Backend couldn't be restarted (port in use)
4. After backend restart, re-test features #12 and #13

### Known Issues

- Playwright browser occasionally gets locked - may need to clear browser profile directory
- Frontend server may need restart if connection is refused
- **SQLite compatibility**: Fixed `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` to use update-then-insert pattern
- Backend process may need manual restart between sessions

### Bug Fixes Applied (need server restart to take effect)

1. **Skills API**: Fixed MySQL `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` to SQLite-compatible update-then-insert
2. **Photo Upload UI**: Added to EditProfile.js (frontend change, no restart needed)

### Test Credentials

- **Worker 1:** Phone: 0821234567, PIN: 4321 (was reset from 1234)
- **Worker 2:** Phone: 0829876543, PIN: 5678 (newly created)
- **Admin:** Username: admin, Password: admin123

## Session 3 Summary (Coding Agent)
Date: 2026-01-16

### Completed Tasks

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Verified worker login still works with test credentials (0821234567 / 4321)
   - Dashboard displays correctly with profile info

2. **Feature #14: Worker profile - bio character limit** ✅
   - Verified bio field has character counter (shows X/500)
   - Tested entering exactly 500 characters
   - Verified counter updates correctly to 500/500
   - Confirmed input is blocked at 500 characters (extra text rejected)
   - Bio saved correctly to database
   - Character counter styling shows warning/limit colors

3. **Feature #15: Worker profile - edit existing profile** ✅
   - Fixed skills API SQLite compatibility bug
   - Verified all form fields are pre-populated with current values
   - Tested changing first name (Johnny → John)
   - Tested changing area selection (Johannesburg2 → Johannesburg1)
   - Tested adding new skill (Taxi Driver with 3 years experience)
   - Tested updating bio text
   - Verified all changes saved successfully to database
   - Verified dashboard displays all updated information
   - Skills now properly handled with check-then-insert pattern

### Bug Fixes

1. **Skills API SQLite Compatibility**
   - File: `backend/src/routes/worker.js`
   - Issue: Skills update used MySQL-style update-then-insert which failed on SQLite when skill already existed with same values
   - Fix: Rewrote to check-existing-then-insert/update pattern:
     - First fetch current skills for worker
     - Delete skills that are no longer selected
     - For each skill, check if exists then update or insert
   - This fix enables the profile edit feature to work correctly

### Files Modified

- `backend/src/routes/worker.js` - Fixed skills API endpoint for SQLite

### Feature Statistics
- Total Features: 116
- Passing: 13 (was 11 at session start)
- In Progress: 0
- Completion: 11.2%

### Test Credentials

- **Worker 1:** Phone: 0821234567, PIN: 4321
  - Profile: John TestWorker, Johannesburg1
  - Skills: Plumber (5 yrs), Taxi Driver (3 yrs)
- **Worker 2:** Phone: 0829876543, PIN: 5678
- **Admin:** Username: admin, Password: admin123

### Next Steps for Future Agents

1. Continue with feature_get_next to get next pending feature
2. All servers start correctly - use npm start in backend/ and frontend/
3. Skills editing now works properly with the fixed backend

## Session 4 Summary (Coding Agent)
Date: 2026-01-16

### Completed Tasks

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Verified worker login still works with test credentials (0821234567 / 4321)

     - Step 2: Navigated to Edit Profile page
     - Step 3: Clicked Delete Account button
     - Step 4: Verified FIRST confirmation dialog appears ("Are you sure you want to delete your account?")

     - Rating was automatically deleted via CASCADE constraint
     - Worker skills also deleted via CASCADE constraint

### Bug Fixes

1. **Admin Login Date Format Bug**
   - File: `backend/src/routes/admin.js`
   - Issue: `expiresAt` was a Date object instead of ISO string, causing SQLite insert to fail
   - Fix: Added `.toISOString()` to convert Date to string
   - Status: Fixed but requires server restart to take effect

### Feature Statistics
- Total Features: 116
- Passing: 14 (was 13 at session start)
- In Progress: 0
