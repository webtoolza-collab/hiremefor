   - Confirmed test worker (John TestWorker, phone: 0821234567, PIN: 1234)

2. **Feature #7: Worker login - invalid PIN rejection** ✅
   - Tested login with incorrect PIN
   - Verified API returns proper error message: "Invalid phone number or PIN"
   - Confirmed no session is created for failed login attempts
   - User remains on login page after failure

3. **Feature #8: Worker logout functionality** ✅
   - Fixed bug: Authorization header wasn't being sent for /auth/logout endpoint
   - Updated api.js interceptor to include token for logout requests
   - Verified session is deleted from database on logout
   - Confirmed accessing protected routes with deleted token returns 401

4. **Feature #9: Worker PIN reset - request OTP** ✅
   - Created ForgotPin.js component with 3-step flow:
     - Step 1: Phone number entry
     - Step 2: OTP verification + new PIN entry
     - Step 3: Success confirmation
   - Added route /worker/forgot-pin to App.js
   - Verified OTP is created with purpose='pin_reset'
   - API correctly sends OTP to registered phone

### Bug Fixes

1. **Logout Authorization Header Bug**
